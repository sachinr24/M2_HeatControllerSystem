## Heat Control System 

## DESCRIPTION
This project aims to explain the task of keeping to control the temprature of the seat .To produce a robust-designed of heat control system. Gives full functional statements to the management of the User. The purpose of this project is to present a general approach to result of controlling the heat of the seats.

## RESEARCH
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the project is to design a CAR SEAT HEAT CONTROL SYSTEM, Climate control is a more sophisticated form of air-conditioning, which allows the temperature of a cars Seats to be accurately controlled. Users can set the required temperature and the system automatically adjusts the speed and amount of cold air introduced into the Seats & cabin

## 4W's and 1'H
WHO:

•All the Car Users & Manufatures who has lot’s of System requirement in their different units and their different services

WHEN:

• As the business of the organisation increases number of System users • With the increases of user end

WHERE:

•This problem is surfaced in all the user and manufacture in the world.

HOW:

•This project takes in all the input values and yields out the management parameters.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
STRENGTH:

• It aims to simplify the task of Showing a accurate result• Simple & Easy to Use

WEAKNESS:

•It is not completely encrypted

OPPURTUNITIES:

In future,more Data such as temprature and seat comfortability can be added apart from the ones which are used here in this project.

THREATS:

Company now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some companies don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
