# M2_HeatControllerSystem
## Introduction
This project aims to explain the task of keeping to control the temprature of the seat .To produce a robust-designed of heat control system. Gives full functional statements to the management of the User. The purpose of this project is to present a general approach to result of controlling the heat of the seats.

## Objective
The aim of the project is to design a CAR SEAT HEAT CONTROL SYSTEM, Climate control is a more sophisticated form of air-conditioning, which allows the temperature of a cars Seats to be accurately controlled. Users can set the required temperature and the system automatically adjusts the speed and amount of cold air introduced into the Seats & cabin
